# Project: SQL_Challenge
  - Data manipulation with Python and SQL

# Description & Steps
  - This entire project is available in: https://github.com/ndressler/SQL_Challenge
  - Virtual env and project repository were created;
  - Tables in the word file given by the challenge were written into TXT files for data analysis;
  - Txt files were stored as dataframes in csv files to later be added to a database (txt_to_sql.py);
  - The previous files are stored in the 'raw_data' file;
  - The questions.py files have all the respective questions proposed by the SQL challenge answered with its code;
  - A Database Schema files were created to provide a better visualization on where the tables have the same information, mainly to view the foreign key connections;
  - The website https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/ was the mean used to visualize the database created in SQLite;
  - I took the liberty to solve the questions in SQLite query in python, rather than solemly SQL, in hopes of showing my skill set in data analysis.
  
# Code function:
  - When executed, the file txt_to_sql.py converts all the txt files into csv and further creates a database to be manipulated and analysed.
  - The files questions_1_to_8.py, questions_9_to_13.py, questions_14_to_23.py and questions_24_to_27.py answer the questions proposed by the challenge, their correspondent files in .txt format are the compilation execution of the code in the terminal.
